Kuzzle monitors its internal activities and make snapshots regularly.
Allows to get the last stored statistics frame.
By default, snapshots are made every 10s.

These statistics include:

* the number of connected users per protocol for the ones which allow to get this information (websocket, udp, ...)
* the number of ongoing requests
* the number of completed requests since the last frame
* the number of failed requests since the last frame

Statistics are returned as a JSON-object with each key being the snapshot's timestamp (utc, in milliseconds).
