When writing or deleting documents in Kuzzle's database layer, the update needs to be indexed before being reflected
in the search index.
By default, this operation can take up to 1 second.

Given an index, the `refresh` action forces a
[`refresh`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/5.x/near-real-time.html#refresh-api),
on it, making the documents visible to search immediately.

    A refresh operation comes with some performance costs.<br>

  <p>
    From <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/5.x/near-real-time.html#refresh-api">
    Elasticsearch documentation</a>:
    <div class="quote">
      "While a refresh is much lighter than a commit, it still has a performance cost.
      A manual refresh can be useful when writing tests, but donâ€™t do a manual refresh every time
      you index a document in production; it will hurt your performance. Instead, your application
      needs to be aware of the near real-time nature of Elasticsearch and make allowances for it."
