```json
{
  "controller": "index",
  "action": "mDelete",
  "body": {
    "indexes": [
      "index1",
      "index2"
    ]
  }
}
```

>**Response**

```javascript
{
  "status": 200, // Assuming everything went well
  "error": null, // Assuming everything went well
  "action": "mDelete",
  "controller": "index",
  "requestId": "<unique request identifier>",
  "result": { // list of actual deleted indexes
    "deleted":[
      "index1",
      "index2"
    ]
  }
}
```

Deletes all `indexes` specified in the body, that current user is allowed to delete, from Kuzzle's persistent storage layer.

If no `indexes` is specified in the body, all the indexes that the current user is allowed to delete will be deleted.

That means: if Kuzzle contains indexes "index1", "index2" and "index3",
but current user is only allowed to delete "index1" and "index2", only both of them are deleted,
and "index3" is kept in the persistent storage layer.

The response contains the list of indexes that were actually deleted.
