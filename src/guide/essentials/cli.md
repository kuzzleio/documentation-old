# Command Line Interface

Kuzzle ships with a [Command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) which enables you to:

* start and stop Kuzzle Core,
* install and configure plugins,
* create the first administrator user,
* reset Kuzzle internal data _(use with caution !)_.

<aside class="warning">
If you are running Kuzzle in a Docker container, you will have to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/">enter the Kuzzle container</a> to run these commands.
</aside>

```bash
$ ./bin/kuzzle

#  Usage: kuzzle [options] [command]
#
#
#  Commands:
#
#    createFirstAdmin          create the first administrator user
#    clearCache                clear internal caches in Redis
#    plugins [options] [name]  manage plugins
#    reset [options]           delete Kuzzle configuration and users from database
#    start [options]           start a Kuzzle instance
#    dump                      create a dump of current state of Kuzzle
#
#  Options:
#
#    -h, --help      output usage information
#    -V, --version   output the version number
#    -d, --debug     make errors more verbose
#    -C, --noColors  do not use ANSI coloring

```

## createFirstAdmin

```bash
$ ./bin/kuzzle createFirstAdmin
```

When Kuzzle runs for the first time, no users are defined and the anonymous user is granted with super-admin rights.

The `createFirstAdmin` command lets you define an administrator user and set your own permissions.

<aside class="notice">NB: This command can only be run interactively</aside>

---

## clearCache

```bash
$ ./bin/kuzzle clearCache
```

Kuzzle relies on the Redis service to store some frequently accessed internal data. If you need to restart Kuzzle with a fresh cache, this command can come in hand.

---

## reset

```bash
$ ./bin/kuzzle reset --help

#    Usage: reset [options]
#
#    delete Kuzzle configuration and users from database
#
#    Options:
#
#      -h, --help             output usage information
#      --fixtures <fixtures>  import some fixtures from file
#      --mappings <mappings>  load and apply mappings from file
#      --noint                non interactive mode
```

The `reset` command deletes all currently set configurations and users from the database.

If business data were imported in Kuzzle's database layer, these are kept intact.

---

## start

```bash
$ ./bin/kuzzle start --help

#    Usage: start [options]
#
#    start a Kuzzle instance
#
#    Options:
#
#      -h, --help                 output usage information
#      -p, --port <port>          Kuzzle port number
#          --fixtures <fixtures>  import some fixtures from file
#          --mappings <mappings>  load and apply mappings from file
```

The `start` command starts a Kuzzle server in the foreground.

---

## dump

```bash
$ ./bin/kuzzle dump --help

#   [ℹ] Creating dump file...
#   [✔] Done!
#   
#   [ℹ] Dump has been successfully generated in "dump/20161214-1555-cli" folder
#   [ℹ] You can send the folder to the kuzzle core team at support@kuzzle.io
```

The `dump` command creates a snapshot of the state of Kuzzle. It includes
* a core dump of Kuzzle Core,
* a dump of the main configuration,
* a dump of all the server logs,
* a dump of the Node.js engine properties,
* a dump of the OS properties,
* a dump of the plugins configuration,
* a dump of the usage statistics of the Kuzzle Server.

This can be particularly handy to feed a crash report to the support team if you own a Kuzzle License.
