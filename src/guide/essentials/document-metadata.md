# Document Metadata

Whenever a document gets created, updated or deleted, Kuzzle Backend will add or update the document's metadata. This metadata provides information about the document's lifecycle.

---

## Overview

Metadata can be viewed in the document's `_meta` field and contains the following properties:

* `author`: The [unique identifier]({{ site_base_path }}guide/kuzzle-depth/authentication/#the-kuzzle-user-identifier-kuid) of the user who created the document.
* `createdAt`: Timestamp of document creation (create or replace), in epoch-milliseconds format
* `updatedAt`: Timestamp of last document update in epoch-milliseconds format, or `null` if no update has been made
* `updater`: The [unique identifier]({{ site_base_path }}guide/kuzzle-depth/authentication/#the-kuzzle-user-identifier-kuid) of the user that updated the document, or `null` if the document has never been updated
* `active`: The status of the document. `true` if the document is active and `false` if the document has been put in the trashcan
* `deletedAt`: Timestamp of document deletion in epoch-milliseconds format, or `null` if the document has not been deleted

Here is an example of a document and its `_meta` field:

```json
{
  "_index": "myindex",
  "_type": "mycollection",
  "_id": "AVkDLAdCsT6qHI7MxLz4",
  "_score": 0.25811607,
  "_source": {
    "message": "Hello World!"
  },
  "_meta": {
    "author": "<kuid>",
    "createdAt": 1481816934209,
    "updatedAt": null,
    "updater": null,
    "active": true,
    "deletedAt": null
  }
}
```

---

## Querying Metadata

Metadata can be queried like any other document property. For example, to query by a document's creation timestamp, we can use the following search filter:

```json
{
  "query": {
      "range": {
          "_meta.createdAt": {
            "lte": 1481816930000
          }
      }
    }
}
```

---

## Documents Deletion

When a document gets deleted, Kuzzle Backend first isolates it from other active documents by placing it in the `trashcan`.

Documents in the `trashcan` cannot be accessed, searched or counted, unless the `includeTrash` flag is set to `true` when invoking the API route.

---

## Garbage Collection

Kuzzle Backend will routinely search and permanently delete the oldest documents in the `trashcan`. This garbage collecting can be configured using the `services.garbageCollector` property in the Kuzzle Backend [configuration file]({{ site_base_path }}guide/essentials/configuration/). In general, garbage collection works as follows:

* When Kuzzle Backend is started, it will check the `services.garbageCollector` property and wait the configured delay before running the garbage collection for the first time.
* If Kuzzle Backend is in [overload]({{ site_base_path }}kuzzle-events/core/#core-overload) the garbage collecting will be postponed until the load is reduced.
