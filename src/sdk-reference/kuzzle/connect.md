# connect

```js
kuzzle.connect();
```

```java
kuzzle.connect();
```

```php
<?php

// not implemented (this SDK uses HTTP and is thus stateless)
```

Connects to the Kuzzle instance using the provided `host` in the constructor.
Has no effect if ``connect`` is set to ``auto``, unless ``disconnect`` has been called first.

---

## Return value

Returns the `Kuzzle` object to allow chaining.

---

## Callback response

If a callback has been provided to the `Kuzzle` constructor, it will be called with the `Kuzzle` instance once successfully connected
