# refreshIndex

```js
kuzzle.refreshIndex('myIndex');
```

```java
kuzzle.refreshIndex("myIndex");
```

```php
<?php
use \Kuzzle\Kuzzle;

$kuzzle = new Kuzzle('localhost');

try {
  $kuzzle->refreshIndex('myIndex');
}
catch (ErrorException $e) {

}
```

When writing or deleting documents in Kuzzle's database layer, the update needs to be indexed before being reflected
in the search index.  
By default, this operation can take up to 1 second.

Given an index, the `refresh` action forces a [`refresh`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/5.x/near-real-time.html#refresh-api),
 on it, making the documents visible to search immediately.

<aside class="left warning">
    A refresh operation comes with some performance costs.<br>
    <br>
    From <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/5.x/near-real-time.html#refresh-api">elasticsearch documentation</a>:
    <div class="quote">
    "While a refresh is much lighter than a commit, it still has a performance cost. A manual refresh can be useful when writing tests, but donâ€™t do a manual refresh every time you index a document in production; it will hurt your performance. Instead, your application needs to be aware of the near real-time nature of Elasticsearch and make allowances for it."
