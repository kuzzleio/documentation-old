## Events

The [Kuzzle object](/sdk-reference/kuzzle/) exposes a set of events triggered on some cases. To subscribe or unsubscribe on these events, simply plug a callback function to the event you want to listen, using the functions [addListener](/sdk-reference/kuzzle/add-listener) and [removeListener](/sdk-reference/kuzzle/remove-listener).
