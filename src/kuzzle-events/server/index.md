**Event type:** Pipe

**Payload:** a [Request]({{ site_base_path }}plugins-reference/plugins-context/constructors/#request) object

All actions in the `server` controllers trigger this event before execution. The `<Action>` part of the event name is replaced with the name of the action, where each word starts with a capital letter.

Example: before performing a [now]({{ site_base_path }}api-documentation/controller-server/now/) request, a `server:beforeNow` event is triggered.
