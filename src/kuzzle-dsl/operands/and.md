# and

The `and` filter takes an array of filter objects, combining them with AND operands.

## Given the following documents:

```javascript
{
  firstName: 'Grace',
  lastName: 'Hopper',
  city: 'NYC',
  hobby: 'computer'
},
{
  firstName: 'Ada',
  lastName: 'Lovelace',
  city: 'London',
  hobby: 'computer'
}
```

## The following filter validates the first document:

```javascript
{
  and: [
    {
      equals: {
        city: 'NYC'
      }
    },
    {
      equals: {
        hobby: 'computer'
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
