# The plugin context

The plugin context is an object containing a set of constructors, accessors and configurations, allowing plugins to interact with Kuzzle.

A plugin context is provided by Kuzzle to plugins when calling their `init` function.  
Each plugin receives its own plugin context instance.

Here is the list of shared objects contained in the provided ``context``:

| Attribute path | Purpose                      |
|----------------|------------------------------|
| `context.accessors.execute` | Access to Kuzzle API |
| `context.accessors.router` | Access to Kuzzle protocol communication system. Allow **protocol** plugins to interface themselves with Kuzzle. |
| `context.accessors.storage` | Initiate and configure to the plugin storage. This storage can only be accessed by the plugin and can be used to persist plugin datas. |
| `context.accessors.validation` | Access to validation mechanisms, useful to validate documents and add field types. |
| `context.config` | Contains the entire Kuzzle instance configuration (most of it coming from Kuzzle configuration file) |
| `context.constructors.Dsl` | Constructor allowing plugins to instantiate their own Kuzzle real-time engine instance |
| `context.constructors.Repository` | Constructor allowing plugins to instantiate their Repositories allowing them to interact with their plugin storage |
| `context.constructors.Request` | Constructor for standardized requests sent to Kuzzle |
| `context.constructors.BaseValidationType` | Constructor for the Validation Type base constructor |
| `context.errors.<ErrorConstructor>` |Kuzzle error constructors, built dynamically from available Kuzzle error objects at runtime |
| `context.log.<level>(message)` | Provides methods to log messages depending on their priority level |

**Note:** `context.accessors` are not available to [worker plugins](/plugins-reference/plugins-features/adding-hooks/#executing-hooks-in-separate-threads), as they are run in their own process(es), without access to Kuzzle instances.
