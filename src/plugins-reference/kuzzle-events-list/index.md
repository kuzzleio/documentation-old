# Kuzzle events list

Every time Kuzzle receives a request coming from a client, it routes it towards a Controller and an Action, which processes it and sends the result back to the client. Each step of this life-cycle triggers an event. Below are the different types of events that Plugins can listen to.

---

## [Plugins events]

[Plugins](#adding-a-controller-route) may add new controllers and actions to Kuzzle's API. These do not differ from native controllers/actions and these, too, trigger events that can be listened by plugins.

| Event | Description | Payload |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `<pluginName>/<controller>:after<Action>` | Triggered after the action `action` of the controller `controller` added by the plugin `pluginName` has completed | Type: Request |
| `<pluginName>/<controller>:before<Action>` | Triggered before the action `action` of the controller `controller` added by the plugin `pluginName` has started | Type: Request |

**Example:**

The plugin `foo` adds a controller named `fooController`, containing an action named `fooAction`.

When an API request invokes this new API route, Kuzzle will automatically trigger the following events:

* `foo/fooController:beforeFooAction` (before the request starts)
* `foo/fooController:afterFooAction` (after the request completes)
