# Adding a controller route

Kuzzle API is divided into "controllers", each one of them exposing "actions" to execute (see [API reference]({{ site_base_path }}api-documentation/query-syntax/common-attributes)).

Plugins enable to add a set of new controllers to the Kuzzle public API, each with their own list of available actions.

---

## How is the API extended

To avoid name conflicts, added controllers are prefixed with the plugin name.

### HTTP

**URL:** `http://<server>:<port>/_plugin/<plugin name>/<url defined by the plugin>/<resources>`  
**Method:** `<verb defined by the plugin>`

### Others protocols

```javascript
{
  "controller": "<plugin name>/<added controller name>",
  "action": "<action of the added controller>",
  ...
}
```

---

## Implementing a controller route

To create a new controller, the Plugin must expose to Kuzzle the following objects:

- A `controllers` object, describing the new controller(s) to add. It will automatically be made available to any network protocol, except for HTTP
- A `routes` objects, describing how the new controller(s) should be exposed to the HTTP protocol. Only GET and POST verbs are accepted.
- Controller's actions functions. These methods take a `Request` object as an argument, and must return a `Promise` resolving with the action's result, or rejecting with a KuzzleError object.


---

## How Plugins receive action arguments

All action functions receive a [Request]({{ site_base_path }}plugins-reference/plugins-context/constructors/#request) object as main argument. Kuzzle will fill it with arguments provided by clients invoking the added controller:

* HTTP:
  * dynamic arguments provided in the URL, headers and query string arguments are stored in `request.input.args`
  * content body is made available in `request.input.body`
  * if the URL contains an `index`, a `collection` or a `_id` argument, it will be stored in `request.input.resource`

* Other protocols:
  * if the provided JSON object contains a `body` object, then its content will be stored in `request.input.body`
  * the following fields at the root of the provided JSON objects are available in `request.input.resource`: `index`, `collection`, `_id`
  * any unrecognized property at the root of the provided JSON object will be stored in the `request.input.args` part of the `Request` object

## TL;DR plugin skeleton

```javascript
class ControllerPlugin {
  constructor () {
    /*
      This exposed "controllers" property tells Kuzzle that it needs to extend
      its API with new controllers and actions.

      Here, we add a controller "newController", with 2 described actions:
      "myAction" and "myOtherAction".

      These actions point to functions exposed to Kuzzle by the plugin.

      Any network protocol other than HTTP will be able to invoke this new
      controller with the following JSON object:

      {
        controller: '<plugin name>/newController',
        action: 'myAction',
        ...
      }
     */
    this.controllers = {
      newController: {
        myAction: 'actionFunction',
        myOtherAction: 'otherActionFunction'
      }
    };

    /*
      We also want to expose our new controller to the HTTP protocol.
      To do so, we give Kuzzle instructions on how we want to expose our
      controller to HTTP.
      Any parameter starting with a ':' in the URL will be made dynamic by Kuzzle.

      The first route exposes the following GET URL:
        http://<kuzzle server>:<port>/_plugin/<plugin name>/foo/<dynamic value>

      Kuzzle will provide the function 'actionFunction' with a Request object,
      containing the "name" property: request.input.args.name = '<dynamic value>'

      The second route exposes the following POST URL:
        http://<kuzzle server>:<port>/_plugin/<plugin name>/bar

      Kuzzle will provide the content body of the request in the Request object
      passed to the function 'otherActionFunction', in the request.input.body
      property
     */
    this.routes = [
      {verb: 'get', url: '/foo/:name', controller: 'newController', action: 'myAction'},
      {verb: 'post', url: '/bar', controller: 'newController', action: 'myOtherAction'}
    ];
  }

  /*
    Required plugin initialization function
    (see the "Plugin prerequisites" section)
   */
  init (customConfig, context) {
    // plugin initialization
  }

  /*
    Implements the action newController/myAction
    Takes a Request object as an argument, and MUST return
    a promise resolved (or rejected) with the action's result
    This result can be of any JS type (scalar, object, array), and
    will be used to build a response to send to the requesting client

    See the "How plugins receive action arguments" chapter just below
    for more information.
   */
  actionFunction (request) {
    // do action

    // optional: set network specific headers
    if (request.context.protocol === 'http') {
      // expires in 1h
      request.response.setHeader('expires', new Date(Date.now() + 3600000).toUTCString());
    }

    // Resolve with the result content. For instance:
    return Promise.resolve({acknowledge: true});
  }

  /*
    Implements the action newController/myOtherAction
    Takes a Request object as an argument, and MUST return
    a promise resolved (or rejected) with the action's result
    This result can be of any JS type (scalar, object, array), and
