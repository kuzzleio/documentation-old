# Adding an authentication strategy

Kuzzle handles users security and authentication. The supported authentication strategies can be extended by Plugins.

Any strategy supported by [Passport](http://passportjs.org/) can be used to extend Kuzzle supported strategies, like we did with our official [OAUTH2 Authentication plugin](https://github.com/kuzzleio/kuzzle-plugin-auth-passport-oauth).

---

## Choose or implement a Passport strategy

[Passport](http://passportjs.org) supports a wide range of authentication strategies. If that is not enough, you can also implement your own strategy for your authentication Plugin.

In any case, the chosen strategy must be available in the Plugin local directory when Kuzzle installs it, either by adding the strategy in the Plugin's NPM dependencies, or by including the strategy code directly in the Plugin repository.

---

## Expose authentication strategies

The `strategies` object must contain one attribute per added strategy. This attribute must be named after the strategy name and be an object containing:

* config: The configuration part
  * constructor: The constructor of the Passport strategy
  * strategyOptions: The options provided to the Passport strategy constructor
  * authenticateOptions: The options provided to the Passport's [authenticate method](http://passportjs.org/docs/authenticate).
  * fields: The list of fields that can be provided to the plugin.
* methods:
  * create: The name of the `create` function in the plugin object.
  * delete: The name of the `delete` function in the plugin object.
  * exists: The name of the `exists` function in the plugin object.
  * getInfo: The name of the `getInfo` function in the plugin object.
  * update: The name of the `update` function in the plugin object.
  * validate: The name of the `validate` function in the plugin object.
  * verify: The name of the `verify` function in the plugin object.


---

## The verify function

You have to implement a [`verify` function](http://passportjs.org/docs/configure) (its name depends on the configuration provided in the `strategies` attribute), which will be used by Kuzzle to authorize or to deny access to a user.

The number of arguments taken by this `verify` function depends on the authentication strategy. For instance, a `local password` strategy needs the `verify` callback to be provided with an `username` and his `password`.

Here is the generic signature of the `verify` function you have to implement:

`verify(request, ...)`

* `request` is the login request made to passport. The object format is `{query: {passport: 'crendentials'}, original: Request}` (see [the `Request` documentation](/plugins-reference/plugins-context/constructors/#request))
* `...`: varies, depending on the used strategy

The function **must** return a `Promise` that resolves to either the user [`<kuid>`](/guide/kuzzle-depth/authentication/#the-kuzzle-user-identifier-kuid) if the user is authenticated, or an object containing a message string attribute giving the reason why it can not be authenticated. The function should reject the Promise if an error occurs (note: an authentication rejection is *not* an error).

---

## The exists function

You have to implement an `exists` function (its name depends on the configuration provided in the `strategies` attribute), which will be used by Kuzzle to verify if a user can be authenticated using your strategy.

Here is the generic signature of the `exists` function you have to implement:

`exists (request, kuid)`

* `request` is the request made to Kuzzle (see [the `Request` documentation](/plugins-reference/plugins-context/constructors/#request)).
* `kuid` is the user [`<kuid>`](/guide/kuzzle-depth/authentication/#the-kuzzle-user-identifier-kuid).

The function **must** return a `Promise` that resolves to a boolean depending on the user ability to authenticate with a strategy.

---

## The create function

You have to implement an `create` function (its name depends on the configuration provided in the `strategies` attribute), used by Kuzzle to add credentials to a user using this strategy.

Here is the generic signature of the `create` function you have to implement:

`create (request, credentials, kuid)`

* `request` is the request made to Kuzzle (see [the `Request` documentation](/plugins-reference/plugins-context/constructors/#request)).
* `credentials` is the content of the credentials to create, that have already been passed to your `validate` function.
* `kuid` is the user [`<kuid>`](/guide/kuzzle-depth/authentication/#the-kuzzle-user-identifier-kuid).

The function **must** return a `Promise` that resolves to an object that contains **non sensitive** information of the object (can be an empty object).

<aside class="warning">
  The credentials have to be persisted, either by using the <a href="/plugins-reference/plugins-context/constructors/#repository">Repository constructor</a>, or any external service.
</aside>

---

## The update function

You have to implement an `update` function (its name depends on the configuration provided in the `strategies` attribute), used by Kuzzle to update a user's credentials to this strategy.

Here is the generic signature of the `update` function you have to implement:

`update (request, credentials, kuid)`

* `request` is the request made to Kuzzle (see [the `Request` documentation](/plugins-reference/plugins-context/constructors/#request)).
* `credentials` is the content of the credentials to create, that have already been passed to your `validate` function.
* `kuid` is the user [`<kuid>`](/guide/kuzzle-depth/authentication/#the-kuzzle-user-identifier-kuid).

The function **must** return a `Promise` that resolves to an object that contains **non sensitive** information of the object (can be an empty object).

<aside class="warning">
  The credentials have to be persisted, either by using the <a href="/plugins-reference/plugins-context/constructors/#repository">Repository constructor</a>, or any external service.
</aside>

---

## The delete function

You have to implement a `delete` function (its name depends on the configuration provided in the `strategies` attribute), used by Kuzzle to delete a user's credentials to this strategy.

Here is the generic signature of the `delete` function you have to implement:

`delete (request, kuid)`

* `request` is the request made to Kuzzle (see [the `Request` documentation](/plugins-reference/plugins-context/constructors/#request)).
* `kuid` is the user [`<kuid>`](/guide/kuzzle-depth/authentication/#the-kuzzle-user-identifier-kuid).

The function **must** return a `Promise` that resolves to any value if deletion succeeds.

---

## The getInfo function

You may implement a `getInfo` function (its name depends on the configuration provided in the `strategies` attribute), used by Kuzzle to get informations about a user's credentials to this strategy. For security reasons, only **non sensitive** informations should be returned.

Here is the generic signature of the `getInfo` function you have to implement:

`getInfo (request, kuid)`

* `request` is the request made to Kuzzle (see [the `Request` documentation](/plugins-reference/plugins-context/constructors/#request)).
* `kuid` is the user [`<kuid>`](/guide/kuzzle-depth/authentication/#the-kuzzle-user-identifier-kuid).

The function **must** return a `Promise` that resolves to an object that contains **non sensitive** information of the object (can be an empty object).

<aside class="info">
  If no getInfo function is provided, an empty object will be returned by controllers that use it.
</aside>

---

## The getById function

You may implement a `getById` function (its name depends on the configuration provided in the `strategies` attribute), used by Kuzzle to get informations about a user's credentials to this strategy searching by the strategy storage identifier (`_id`). For security reasons, only **non sensitive** informations should be returned.

Here is the generic signature of the `getInfo` function you have to implement:

`getInfo (request, id)`

* `request` is the request made to Kuzzle (see [the `Request` documentation](/plugins-reference/plugins-context/constructors/#request)).
* `id` is the user's storage identifier in the strategy.

The function **must** return a `Promise` that resolves to an object that contains **non sensitive** information of the object (can be an empty object).

<aside class="info">
  If no getById function is provided, an empty object will be returned by controllers that use it.
</aside>

---

## The afterRegister function

You may implement a `afterRegister` function (its name depends on the configuration provided in the `strategies` attribute), which will be called once the strategy constructor has been build

Here is the generic signature of the `afterRegister` function you have to implement:

`afterRegister (constructedStrategy)`

* `constructedStrategy` is the instance of the Passport strategy constructor.

The function **may** return any value as it will be ignored.

<aside class="info">
  If no afterRegister function is provided, Kuzzle won't try to call it, and register will process as expected.
</aside>

---

## The validate function

You have to implement a `validate` (its name depends on the configuration provided in the `strategies` attribute), which will be used by Kuzzle to check if the provided user's credentials to this strategy are well-formed.

Here is the generic signature of the `validate` function you have to implement:

`validate (request, credentials, kuid, isUpdate)`

* `request` is the request made to Kuzzle (see [the `Request` documentation](/plugins-reference/plugins-context/constructors/#request)).
* `credentials` is the content of the credentials to create or update.
* `kuid` is the user [`<kuid>`](/guide/kuzzle-depth/authentication/#the-kuzzle-user-identifier-kuid).
* `isUpdate` is true if `validate` is called during an update.

The function **must** return a `Promise` that resolves to true or rejects with an error explaining the reason.

<aside class="warning">
  Validate can be called during an update with partial information. The validation should behave accordingly when isUpdate is true, knowing that mandatory information should already have been stored during a previous create call.
</aside>
