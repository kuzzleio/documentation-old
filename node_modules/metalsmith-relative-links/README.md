What It Does
------------

Each source file will have a `link()` function added to the metadata, allowing easier link generation.  There are also helper functions: `link.from()`, `link.to()`, and `link.resolve()`.  One would use these functions in templates to generate links to other resources.  This is an extremely handy plugin when you have a file tree in the metadata.  It works great with [metalsmith-hbt-md] and [metalsmith-ancestry].  Those two plugins will process [Mustache] templates in markdown and add a file hierarchy to the metadata.  It's useful for creating subpage listings:

    {{#ancestry.children}}
    * [{{title}}]({{link.from ancestry.parent}}) - {{summary}}
    {{/ancestry.children}}

Now you simply add another page to your sources and rerun Metalsmith.  Your index page is updated automatically.


### `link(from, to)`

Returns a relative link between `from` and `to`.  If `from` is "tools/hammer.html" and `to` is "tools/hammer/claw.html", the link returned would be "hammer/claw.html".

The `from` and `to` arguments are resolved to strings by `link.resolve()`.

Options also control how the links are generated.  See more about that in the Usage section.


### `link.from(to)`

Shorthand to create a link from the current file object to a given destination.  More details listed in `link()` and `link.resolve()`.


### `link.resolve(what)`

This changes `what` into a string.  It can be any of the following.

* File object.  This is looked up and its key is used as the resolved value.  This lets you link from one file object to another without knowing where in your directory hierarchy they are located.
* Relative paths, such as "..", "folder/file.html".  These are resolved against the current file object's location so they act exactly as you would imagine.
* Absolute paths, such as "/filename.html" or "/folder/file.html".  These are resolved against the root.
* Empty string.  Resolved as a link to the root and is functionally the same as "/".

When none of these match, an error is thrown.


### `link.to(from)`

Shorthand to create a link from the specified resource to the current file object.  Check out `link()` and `link.resolve()` for further information.


Installation
------------

`npm` can do this for you.

    npm install --save metalsmith-relative-links


Usage
-----

Include this like you would include any other plugin.  Here is the CLI example that also shows the default options.  You don't need to specify any options unless you wish to override their values.

    {
        "plugins": {
            "metalsmith-relative-links": {
                "linkProperty": "link",
                "match": "**/*.{htm,html}",
                "matchOptions": {}
            }
        }
    }

And here is how to use JavaScript to include the plugin along with a brief description of each option.  The JavaScript version also lets you modify the links using your own function with the `modifyLinks` configuration option.

    // Load this, just like other plugins.
    var links = require("metalsmith-relative-links");

    // Then in your list of plugins you use it.
    .use(links())

    // Alternately, you can specify options.  The values shown here are
    // the defaults.
    .use(links({
        // Name of property that should get the link function
        linkProperty: "link",

        // Pattern of files to match
        match: "**/*.htm,html",

        // Options for matching files.  See minimatch.
        matchOptions: {},

        // Function to modify links.  See below.
        modifyLinks: function (uri) {
            return uri.replace(/\.md$/, ".html").replace(/(^|\/|\\)index.html$/, "$1");
        }
    })

This uses [minimatch] to match files.  The `.matchOptions` object can be filled with options that the [minimatch] library uses.

The `modifyLinks()` function will, by default, change all `*.md` links into `*.html` and remove any `index.html` at the end of a URI.  If you'd like different behavior, this function is able to be replaced.  Let's say you wanted no file extensions ever and always create directory-style permalinks.  Here's a sample function that does just that.

    function (uri) {
        // Remove all extensions
        uri = uri.replace(/\.[^.]*$/, "");

        // Make sure we always link to a folder
        uri = uri + "/";

        return uri;
    }

For more complex behavior, the `modifyLinks()` function is passed additional arguments.

    function (uri, fromResolved, toResolved) {
        // uri: A relative link that points at the destination
        // fromResolved: The location of the link originator
        // toResolved: The location of the link destination
        return resultThatYouWant;
    }
