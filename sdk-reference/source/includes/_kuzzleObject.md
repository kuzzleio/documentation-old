# Kuzzle

This is the main entry point to communicate with Kuzzle. Every other objects inherits properties from this one.

Here is the object diagram of our SDKs:

![object diagram](./images/objectDiagram.png)

## Constructors

Connects to a Kuzzle instance.


```js
/*
 As this SDK embarks two protocols instead of just one (WebSocket and SocketIO),
 the "port" option has been replaced by a "wsPort" and "ioPort" ones, used
 to set, respectively, the WebSocket port and the SocketIO one.

 These ports are defaulted to Kuzzle default values, so you only have to change
 them if you modify the protocols default values server-side.
 */
var kuzzle = new Kuzzle('localhost', {
  defaultIndex: 'some index',
  autoReconnect: true,
  headers: {someheader: "value"},
  ioPort: 7512,
  wsPort: 7513
});

// A callback is also available and will be invoked once connected to the Kuzzle instance:
kuzzle = new Kuzzle('localhost', function (err, res) {
  // ...
});
```

```java
KuzzleOptions options = new KuzzleOptions();

options.setDefaultIndex("some index")
  .setAutoReconnect(true),
  .setHeaders(new JSONObject().put("someheader", "value"))
  .setPort(7512);

Kuzzle kuzzle = new Kuzzle("localhost", options, new KuzzleResponseListener<Void>() {
 @Override
 public void onSuccess(Void object) {
   // invoked once connected, object contains the kuzzle instance
 }

 @Override
 public void onError(JSONObject error) {
   // Handle connection error
 }
});
```

```objective_c
NSError* error = nil;
KuzzleOptions* opt = [[KuzzleOptions alloc] init];
opt.defaultIndex = @"some index";
opt.headers = @{
     @"someheader": @"value"
};
opt.port = 7512;
Kuzzle* kuzzle = [[Kuzzle alloc] initWithHost:@"localhost" options: opt connectionCallback:^(id object, NSError * errorConnection) {
  if(errorConnection) {
    // error occured
  }
  // everything went fine
} error: &error];

if(error) {
  // kuzzle was not initialized properly and error was thrown
}

### Kuzzle(host, [options], [callback])


| Arguments | Type | Description |
|---------------|---------|----------------------------------------|
| ``host`` | string | The server name (or the IP address) of a Kuzzle instance |
| ``options`` | JSON object | Optional Kuzzle connection configuration |
| ``callback`` | function | Optional callback |

Available options:

| Option | Type | Description | Default |
|---------------|---------|----------------------------------------|---------|
| ``autoQueue`` | boolean | Automatically queue all requests during offline mode | ``false`` |
| ``autoReconnect`` | boolean | Automatically reconnect after a connection loss | ``true`` |
| ``autoReplay`` | boolean | Automatically replay queued requests on a ``reconnected`` event | ``false`` |
| ``autoResubscribe`` | boolean | Automatically renew all subscriptions on a ``reconnected`` event | ``true`` |
| ``connect`` | string | Manually or automatically connect to the Kuzzle instance | ``auto`` |
| ``defaultIndex`` | string | Set the default index to use | |
| ``headers`` | JSON object | Common headers for all sent documents | |
| ``ioPort`` | integer | (Javascript SDK only) Kuzzle network port for socket.io | 7512 |
| ``metadata`` | JSON object | Common metadata, will be sent to all future requests | |
| ``offlineMode`` | string | Offline mode configuration | ``manual`` |
| ``port`` | integer | (All SDKs except Javascript) Kuzzle network port | 7512 |
| ``queueTTL`` | integer | Time a queued request is kept during offline mode, in milliseconds | ``120000`` |
| ``queueMaxSize`` | integer | Number of maximum requests kept during offline mode | ``500`` |
| ``replayInterval`` | integer | Delay between each replayed requests, in milliseconds | ``10`` |
| ``reconnectionDelay`` | integer | number of milliseconds between reconnection attempts | ``1000`` |
| ``sslConnection`` | boolean | Switch Kuzzle connection to SSL mode | ``false`` |
| ``wsPort`` | integer | (Javascript SDK only) Kuzzle network port for websocket | 7513 |

**Notes:**

* the ``offlineMode`` option only accepts the ``manual`` and ``auto`` values
* the Javascript SDK accepts `ioPort` and `wsPort` options instead of the `port` one. This is because this SDK supports 2 network protocols to ensure maximum performances AND compatibility depending on browsers capabilities

### Callback response

If the connection succeeds, resolves to the `Kuzzle` object itself.
If the `connect` option is set to `manual`, the callback will be called after the `connect` method is resolved.

| ``reconnectionDelay`` | integer | number of milliseconds between reconnection attempts | get |
| ``wsPort`` | integer | (Javascript SDK only) Kuzzle network port for websocket | 7513 |

**Notes:**

* if ``connect`` is set to ``manual``, the ``connect`` method will have to be called manually
* the kuzzle instance will automatically queue all requests, and play them automatically once a first connection is established, regardless of the ``connect`` or offline mode option values.
* multiple methods allow passing specific ``metadata``. These ``metadata`` will be merged with the global Kuzzle object ``metadata`` when sending the request, with the request specific ``metadata`` taking priority over the global ones.
* the ``queueFilter`` property is a function taking a JSON object as an argument. This object is the request sent to Kuzzle, following the [Kuzzle Websocket API](http://kuzzleio.github.io/kuzzle-api-documentation/) format
* if ``queueTTL`` is set to ``0``, requests are kept indefinitely
* The offline buffer acts like a FIFO queue, meaning that if the ``queueMaxSize`` limit is reached, older requests are deleted and new requests are queued
* if ``queueMaxSize`` is set to ``0``, an unlimited number of requests is kept until the buffer is flushed
* the ``offlineQueueLoader`` must be set with a function, taking no argument, and returning an array of objects containing a `query` member with a Kuzzle query to be replayed, and an optional `cb` member with the corresponding callback to invoke with the query result
* the ``host`` and ``port`` properties can be changed, but it will only be in effect at the next ``connect`` call
* the Javascript SDK accepts `ioPort` and `wsPort` options instead of the `port` one. This is because this SDK supports 2 network protocols to ensure maximum performances AND compatibility depending on browsers capabilities

## Offline mode

Working with an unstable network connection implies to handle what an application should be doing while being offline.  
Our goal is to provide our users with the right tools to handle such situations.


**There are two ways to handle a network disconnection**

* Stop all further communication with Kuzzle and invalidate the current instance and all its children. The application will have to manually instantiate a new Kuzzle object once the network has recovered. To do so, simply pass the ``autoReconnect`` option to ``false`` when starting a new Kuzzle instance.
* Reconnect automatically to Kuzzle when possible, and enter *offline mode*. This is the default behavior.

Offline mode simply refers to the time between a ``disconnected`` and a ``reconnected`` event.

**Handling subscriptions**

During offline mode, all subscriptions are kept indefinitely, with no maximum subscriptions retained.

By default, upon reconnection, all subscription are renewed. This behavior can be changed by setting the ``autoResubscribe`` to ``false``. In that case, each subscription must be renewed manually using the ``KuzzleRoom.renew`` method.

**Queuing requests while offline**

Requests can be queued while being offline, to be replayed once the network connection has been reestablished.  
By default, there is no request queuing.

You can:

* Queue all requests automatically when going offline by setting the ``autoQueue`` option to ``true``
* Start and stop queuing manually, by using the ``startQueuing`` and ``stopQueuing`` methods

The queue itself can be configured using the ``queueTTL`` and ``queueMaxSize`` options.

**Filter requests to be queued**

After request queuing is activated, by default, all requests are queued.

You can decide to filter some of these requests with the ``queueFilter`` property. This property must be set with a function taking the request to be queued as an argument, and it must return a boolean telling the Kuzzle SDK if the request can be queued or not.

Additionally, almost all methods accept a ``queuable`` option. If set to ``false``, the request will be discarded if the SDK is disconnected, and it will be played immediately with no queuing otherwise. This option bypasses the ``queueFilter`` property.


**Handling network reconnection**

Once a ``reconnected`` event is fired, you may replay the content of the queue with the ``replayQueue`` method. Or you can let the SDK replay it automatically upon reconnection, by setting the ``autoReplay`` option to ``true``.  

Requests are sent to Kuzzle with the ``replayInterval`` delay between each one of them.

Requests submitted while replaying the queue are delayed until the queue is empty, to ensure all requests are played in the right order.

<aside class="warning">
Setting <code>autoReplay</code> to <code>true</code> when using user authentication should generally be avoided.<br/>
When leaving offline-mode, the JWT Token validity is verified. If it has expired, the token will be removed and a <code>jwtTokenExpired</code> event will be fired.<br/>
If <code>autoReplay</code> is set, then all pending requests will be automatically played as an anonymous user.
</aside>


**Taking control of the offline queue**

You can be notified about what's going on about the offline queue, with the `offlineQueuePush` and the `offlineQueuePop` events.  

The `offlineQueuePush` event is fired whenever a request is queued. It provides to its listeners an object containing a `query` property, describing the queued request, and an optional `cb` property containing the corresponding callback, if any.

The `offlineQueuePop` event is fired whenever a request has been removed from the queue, either because the queue limits have been reached, or because the request has been replayed. It provides the removed request to its listeners.

The `offlineQueueLoader` property allows loading requests to the queue, **before any previously queued request**. It is invoked every time the SDK starts dequeuing requests.  
This property must be set with a function returning an array of objects with the following accessible properties: a `query` property, containing the request to be replayed, and an optional `cb` property pointing to the callback to invoke after the completion of the request.

Finally, if the provided methods don't give you enough control over the offline queue, you can access and edit the queue directly with the ``offlineQueue`` property.



**Automatic offline-mode**

You can set the ``offlineMode`` option to ``auto``. This configures the offline mode behavior with the following options:

* ``autoReconnect`` = ``true``
* ``autoQueue`` = ``true``
* ``autoReplay`` = ``true``
* ``autoResubscribe`` = ``true``


## Event Handling

The Kuzzle object listens to global events fired by Kuzzle. To subscribe or unsubscribe on these events, simply plug a callback function to the event you want to act upon, using the functions ``addListener`` and ``removeListener``.

Here is the list of these special events:

| Event Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ``connected`` | Fired when the SDK has successfully connected to Kuzzle |
| ``disconnected`` | Fired when the current session has been unexpectedly disconnected |
| ``error`` | Fired when the SDK has failed to connect to Kuzzle. Does not trigger offline mode. |
| ``jwtTokenExpired`` | Fired when Kuzzle rejected a request because the authentication token expired.<br/>Provides the request and its associated callback to its listeners |
| ``loginAttempt`` | Fired when a login attempt completes, either with a success or a failure result.<br/>Provides a JSON object with the login status to its listeners (see the `login` method documentation)|
| ``offlineQueuePop`` | Fired whenever a request is removed from the offline queue. <br/>Provides the removed request to its listeners |
| ``offlineQueuePush`` | Fired whenever a request is added to the offline queue.<br/>Provides to its listeners an object containing a `query` property, describing the queued request, and an optional `cb` property containing the corresponding callback |
| ``reconnected`` | Fired when the current session has reconnected to Kuzzle after a disconnection, and only if ``autoReconnect`` is set to ``true`` |
| ``queryError`` | Fired whenever Kuzzle responds with an error |

**Note:** listeners are called in the order of their insertion.

## addListener

```js
  var listenerId = kuzzle.addListener('connected', function (room, subscription) {
    // Actions to perform when receiving a 'subscribed' global event
  });
```

```java
String listenerId = kuzzle.addListener(KuzzleEvent.connected, new IKuzzleEventListener() {
  @Override
  public void trigger(Object... args) {
    // Actions to perform when receiving a 'subscribed' global event
  }
});
```

```objective_c
NSError* error = nil;
[kuzzle addListenerForEvent: KuzzleEventTypeCONNECTED error: &error callback:^(id result, NSError * error) {
  if(error) {
    // error occured
  }
  // everything went fine
}];
```

```swift
kuzzle.addListener(.CONNECTED, callback: { result in
  switch result {
    case let .onError(error):
    // error occured during call, error is NSError
    break
    case let .onSuccess(success):
    // everything went fine, success is AnyObject
    break
  }
})
```

```php
<?php

$kuzzle->addListener('jwtTokenExpired', function() {
  // Actions to perform when receiving a 'jwtTokenExpired' global event
});

```

Adds a listener to a Kuzzle global event. When an event is fired, listeners are called in the order of their insertion.

<aside class="notice">
The ID returned by this function is required if you want to remove this listener later.
</aside>

### addListener(event, listener)

| Arguments | Type | Description |
|---------------|---------|----------------------------------------|
| ``event`` | string | One of the event described in the ``Event Handling`` section of this documentation |
| ``listener`` | function | The function to call each time one of the registered event is fired |

### Return value

Returns a `string` containing an unique listener ID.

## checkToken

```js
// Using callbacks (NodeJS or Web Browser)
kuzzle.checkToken(token, function (err, res) {
  // ...
});

// Using promises (NodeJS only)
kuzzle.checkTokenPromise(token)
  .then(res => {
    // ...
  });
```

```java
kuzzle.checkToken("some jwt token", new KuzzleResponseListener<KuzzleTokenValidity>() {
  @Override
  public void onSuccess(KuzzleTokenValidity tokenInfo) {
    if (tokenInfo.isValid()) {
      // tokenInfo.getExpiresAt() returns the expiration timestamp
    }
    else {
      // tokenInfo.getState() returns the invalidity reason
    }
  }
});
```

```objective_c
NSError* error = nil;
[kuzzle checkTokenWithToken: @"some jwt token" error: &error callback:^(KuzzleTokenValidity * tokenValidity, NSError * error) {
  if(error) {
    // error occured
  }
  // everything went fine
}];
if(error) {
  // NSError reprsentation for KuzzleError.TokenEmpty, when token argument is empty string
  // NSError reprsentation for KuzzleError.IllegalState, when Kuzzle state is .DISCONNECTED
}
```

```swift
do {
  try checkToken(withToken: "some jwt token", callback: { result in
      switch result {
        case let .onError(error):
        // error occured during connecting, error is NSError
        break
        case let .onSuccess(success):
        // everything went fine, success is KuzzleTokenValidity
        break
      }
  })
} catch {
  // KuzzleError.TokenEmpty, when token argument is empty string
  // KuzzleError.IllegalState, when Kuzzle state is .DISCONNECTED
}
```

```php
<?php

$result = $kuzzle->checkToken('some jwt token');

/*
$result = [
  'expiresAt' => 1468257834099, //timestamp in milliseconds
  'valid' => true
];
*/
```

> Callback response if the token is valid:

```json
{
  "expiresAt": 1454588077399,
  "valid": true
}
```

> Callback response if the token is invalid:

```json
{
  "valid": false,
  "state": "<invalidity reason>"
}
```

Checks the validity of a JSON Web Token.

### checkToken(token, callback)

<aside class="notice">
This method is non-queuable, meaning that during offline mode, it will be discarded and the callback will be called with an error.
</aside>

| Arguments | Type | Description |
|---------------|---------|----------------------------------------|
| ``token``    | string   | The token to check |
| ``callback`` | function | Callback handling the response |

**Note:** this method sends an unauthenticated API call to Kuzzle, meaning it ignores the JWT Token property, even if it has been set.

### Callback response

A JSON object with a `valid` boolean property.  
If the token is valid, a `expiresAt` property is set with the expiration timestamp. If not, a `state` property is set explaining why the token is invalid.

## connect

```js
kuzzle.connect();
```

```java
kuzzle.connect();
```

```objective_c
[kuzzle connect];
```

```swift
kuzzle.connect();
```

```php
<?php

// not implemented (sdk PHP is using REST API)
```

Connects to the Kuzzle instance using the provided `host` in the constructor.
Has no effect if ``connect`` is set to ``auto``, unless ``disconnect`` has been called first.

### Return value

Returns the `Kuzzle` object to allow chaining.

### Callback response

If a callback has been provided to the `Kuzzle` constructor, it will be called with the `Kuzzle` instance once successfully connected

opt.defaultIndex = @"some index";
Kuzzle* kuzzle = [[Kuzzle alloc] initWithHost:@"localhost" options: opt error: &error];

KuzzleDataCollection* collection = [kuzzle dataCollectionFactoryWithCollectionName: @"" error: &error];
```

```swift
do {
  try kuzzle.dataCollectionFactory(collectionName: "collection", index: "index")
} catch {
  // KuzzleError.NoIndexSpecified, when defaultIndex and index passed in function are both nil
  // KuzzleError.IllegalState when state is .DISCONNECTED
}
// or using a default index, simplified snippet:
let options = KuzzleOptions()
    options
        .setDefaultIndex("some index")
        .setHeaders([
            "someheader": "value"

Instantiates a new KuzzleDataCollection object.

### dataCollectionFactory(collection, [index])

| Arguments | Type | Description |
|---------------|---------|----------------------------------------|
| ``collection`` | string | The name of the data collection you want to manipulate |
| ``index`` | string | The name of the index containing the data collection |

        case let .onSuccess(autoRefresh):
          // autoRefresh var contains the autoRefresh status of myIndex.
        case let .onError(error)
          // Handle error
    })
} catch {
  //     Handle KuzzleError
  //     * KuzzleError.IllegalState when state is .DISCONNECTED
  //     * KuzzleError.StrategyEmpty when strategy passed to function was empty string
}
```

```php
<?php
use \Kuzzle\Kuzzle;

$kuzzle = new Kuzzle('localhost');
$result = $kuzzle->getAutoRefresh('myIndex');

// $result = true | false
```

The `autoRefresh` flag, when set to true, will make Kuzzle perform a
[`refresh`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/near-real-time.html#refresh-api) request
immediately after each write request, forcing the documents to be immediately visible to search.

The `getAutoRefresh` function returns the current `autoRefresh` status for the given index.

<aside class="left warning">
    <p>
        A refresh operation comes with some performance costs.
    </p>
    <p>
        While forcing the autoRefresh can be convenient on a development or test environmnent, it is advised to avoid
        using it on production or at least to carefully monitor its implications before using it.
    </p>

        // handle the error here
    }
  })

```

```php
<?php
use \Kuzzle\Kuzzle;

$kuzzle = new Kuzzle('localhost');
$result = $kuzzle->security()->getMyRights();

// $result is an array

[kuzzle getServerInfoAndReturnError: &error callback:^(NSDictionary* serverInfo, NSError * error) {
  if(error) {
    // error occured
  }
  // everything went fine
}];
if(error) {
  // NSError reprsentation for KuzzleError.IllegalState, when Kuzzle state is .DISCONNECTED
}
```

```swift
do {
  try kuzzle.getServerInfo(callback: { result in
      switch result {
        case let .onError(error):
        // error occured during call, error is NSError

Kuzzle monitors active connections, and ongoing/completed/failed requests.  
This method allows getting either the last statistics frame, or a set of frames starting from a provided timestamp.

### getStatistics([timestamp], [options], callback)

| Arguments | Type | Description |
|---------------|---------|----------------------------------------|
| ``timestamp`` | Epoch time | Optional starting time from which the frames are to be retrieved |
| ``options`` | JSON object | Optional parameters |
| ``callback`` | function | Callback handling the response |

Available options:

| Option | Type | Description | Default |
|---------------|---------|----------------------------------------|---------|
| ``queuable`` | boolean | Mark this request as (not) queuable | ``true`` |

**Note:** Kuzzle statistics are cleaned up regularly. If the timestamp is set too far in the past, then this method will return all available statistics.

### Callback response

Resolves to an `array` containing one or more statistics frame(s), as JSON objects.

## listCollections

```js
// Using callbacks (NodeJS or Web Browser)
kuzzle.listCollections('index', {type: 'stored', from: 0, size: 42}, function (err, collections) {
  // ...
});

// Using promises (NodeJS only)
kuzzle
  .listCollectionsPromise('index', {type: 'stored'})
  .then(collections => {
    // ...
  });
```

```java
kuzzle.listCollections("index", new KuzzleResponseListener<JSONObject>() {
  @Override
  public void onSuccess(JSONObject object) {
    // ...
  }

  @Override
  public void onError(JSONObject error) {
    // Handle error
  }
});
```

```objective_c
NSError* error = nil;
[kuzzle listCollectionsAndReturnError: &error callback:^(NSDictionary * collections, NSError * error) {
  if(error) {
    // error occured
  }
  // everything went fine

      switch result {
        case let .onError(error):
        // error occured during call, error is NSError
        break
        case let .onSuccess(success):

```js
// Expiration time is expressed as a string following the
// time conversion library: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ms
 var expiresIn = "1h";

// Using callbacks (NodeJS or Web Browser)
kuzzle.login("local", {username: "username", password: "password"}, expiresIn, function (err, res) {
  // ...
});

// Using promises (NodeJS only)
kuzzle.loginPromise("local", {username: "username", password: "password"}, expiresIn)
  .then(res => {
    // ...
  });
```

```java
JSONObject credentials = new JSONObject()
  .put("username", "John Doe")
  .put("password", "my secret password");

kuzzle.login("local", credentials, 30000, new KuzzleResponseListener<JSONObject>() {
  @Override
  public void onSuccess(JSONObject result) {
    // ...
  }

  @Override
  public void onError() {

}];
if(error) {
  // NSError reprsentation for KuzzleError.StrategyEmpty when strategy passed to function was empty string
  // NSError reprsentation for KuzzleError.IllegalState, when Kuzzle state is .DISCONNECTED
}
```

```swift
do {
  try try kuzzle.login(withStrategy: "local", credentials: credentials, callback: { result in
      switch result {
        case let .onError(error):
        // error occured during call, error is NSError
        break
        case let .onSuccess(success):
        // everything went fine, success is Dictionary
        break
      }
  })
} catch {
  // KuzzleError.StrategyEmpty when strategy passed to function was empty string
  // KuzzleError.IllegalState, when Kuzzle state is .DISCONNECTED

```php
<?php
use \Kuzzle\Kuzzle;

$kuzzle = new Kuzzle('localhost');

// Expiration time is expressed as a string following the
// time conversion library: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ms
$expiresIn = "1h";

try {
  $result = $kuzzle->login('local', [
    'username' => 'myusername',
    'password' => 'secret'
  ], $expiresIn);

  // ...
}
catch (ErrorException $e) {
  // Handle error
}
```

Log a user according to a strategy and credentials.

If the Kuzzle response contains a JWT Token, the SDK token is set and the `loginAttempt` event is fired immediately with the following object:  
`{ success: true }`  
This is the case, for instance, with the `local` authentication strategy.

If the request succeeds but there is no token, then it means that the chosen strategy is a two-steps authentication method, like OAUTH. In that case, the `loginAttempt` event is **not** fired. To complete the login attempt, the `setJwtToken` method must be called either with a token or with an appropriate Kuzzle response.

If the login attempt fails, the `loginAttempt` event is fired with the following response:  
`{ success: false, error: 'error message' }`

### login(strategy, [credentials], [expiresIn], [callback])

| Arguments | Type | Description |
|---------------|---------|----------------------------------------|
| ``strategy`` | string | Authentication strategy (local, facebook, github, ...) |
| ``credentials`` | JSON object | Optional login credentials, depending on the strategy |
| ``expiresIn`` | \<varies\> | Login expiration time |
| ``callback`` | function | Optional callback handling the response |

**Note:** If the ``expiresIn`` argument is not set, the default token expiration value will be taken from the Kuzzle server configuration.

By default, kuzzle embed the plugin [kuzzle-plugin-auth-passport-local](https://github.com/kuzzleio/kuzzle-plugin-auth-passport-local) which provide `local` stored password authentication strategy.
This strategy require `username` and `password` as `credentials`

### Callback response

Resolves to a JSON object containing the Kuzzle response.

## refreshIndex

```js
kuzzle.refreshIndex('myIndex');
```

```java
kuzzle.refreshIndex("myIndex");
```

```swift
try kuzzle.refreshIndex("myIndex")
```

```php
<?php
use \Kuzzle\Kuzzle;

$kuzzle = new Kuzzle('localhost');

try {
  $kuzzle->refreshIndex('myIndex');
}
catch (ErrorException $e) {
  // error occured
}
```

When writing or deleting documents in Kuzzle's database layer, the update needs to be indexed before being reflected
in the search index.  
By default, this operation can take up to 1 second.

Given an index, the `refresh` action forces a [`refresh`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/near-real-time.html#refresh-api),
 on it, making the documents visible to search immediately.

<aside class="left warning">
    A refresh operation comes with some performance costs.<br>
    <br>
    From <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/near-real-time.html#refresh-api">elasticsearch documentation</a>:
    <div class="quote">
    "While a refresh is much lighter than a commit, it still has a performance cost. A manual refresh can be useful when writing tests, but don’t do a manual refresh every time you index a document in production; it will hurt your performance. Instead, your application needs to be aware of the near real-time nature of Elasticsearch and make allowances for it."
    </div>
</aside>

|--------|------|-------------|---------
| `queuable` | boolean | Mark this request as (not)queuable | `true`

#### Return value

Returns the `Kuzzle` object to allow chaining.

#### Callback response

The response is a JSON structure matching the response from Elasticsearch.


## removeAllListeners

```js
// Removes all listeners on the "unsubscribed" global event
kuzzle.removeAllListeners('disconnected');

// Removes all listeners on all global events
kuzzle.removeAllListeners();
```

```java
// Removes all listeners on the "unsubscribed" global event
kuzzle.removeAllListeners(KuzzleEvent.disconnected);

// Removes all listeners on all global events
kuzzle.removeAllListeners();
```

```objective_c
// Removes all listeners on the "unsubscribed" global event
[kuzzle removeAllListenersWithEvent: KuzzleEventTypeDISCONNECTED];

// Removes all listeners on all global events
[kuzzle removeAllListeners];
```

```swift
// Removes all listeners on the "unsubscribed" global event
kuzzle.removeAllListeners(event: .DISCONNECTED);

// Removes all listeners on all global events
kuzzle.removeAllListeners();
```

```php
<?php
use \Kuzzle\Kuzzle;

$kuzzle = new Kuzzle('localhost');

// Removes all listeners on the "jwtTokenExpired" global event
$kuzzle->removeAllListeners('jwtTokenExpired');

// Removes all listeners on all global events
$kuzzle->removeAllListeners();
```

Removes all listeners, either from a specific event or from all events

### removeAllListeners([event])

```

```objective_c
[kuzzle replayQueue];
```

```swift
kuzzle.replayQueue()
```

```php
<?php

## setAutoRefresh

```js
kuzzle.setAutoRefresh('myIndex', true);
```

```swift
try kuzzle.setAutoRefresh("myIndex", autoRefresh: true)
```

```java
kuzzle.setAutoRefresh("myIndex", true);
```

```php
<?php
use \Kuzzle\Kuzzle;

$kuzzle = new Kuzzle('localhost');

$kuzzle->setAutoRefresh('myIndex', true);
```

The `autoRefresh` flag, when set to true, will make Kuzzle perform a
[`refresh`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/near-real-time.html#refresh-api) request
immediately after each write request, forcing the documents to be immediately visible to search.

Given an index, the `setAutoRefresh` function updates its `autoRefresh` status.

<aside class="left warning">
    <p>
        A refresh operation comes with some performance costs.
    </p>
    <p>
        While forcing the autoRefresh can be convenient on a development or test environmnent, it is advised to avoid
        using it on production or at least to carefully monitor its implications before using it.
    </p>
</aside>

## setHeaders

```js
kuzzle.setHeaders({someContent: 'someValue'}, true);
```

```java
JSONObject headers = new JSONObject().put("someContent", "someValue");

kuzzle.setHeaders(headers, true);
```

```objective_c
NSDictionary* headers = @{@"someContent": @"someValue"};

[kuzzle setHeadersWithData: headers replace: YES];
// merge headers with already existing ones
[kuzzle setHeadersWithData: headers];
```

```swift
let headers = ["someContent": "someValue"]

kuzzle.setHeaders(content: headers, replace: true)
// merge headers with already existing ones
kuzzle.setHeaders(content: headers);
```

```php
<?php
use \Kuzzle\Kuzzle;

$kuzzle = new Kuzzle('localhost');

$newHeaders = [
  'someContent' => 'someValue'
];

$kuzzle->setHeaders($newHeaders);
```

This is a helper function returning itself, allowing to easily chain calls.

| Arguments | Type | Description |
|---------------|---------|----------------------------------------|
| ``content`` | JSON Object | New content |
| ``replace`` | boolean | true: replace the current content with the provided data, false: merge it |

**Note:** by default, the ``replace`` argument is set to ``false``

### Return value

Returns the `Kuzzle` object to allow chaining.

## setJwtToken

```js
// Directly with a JWT Token
kuzzle.setJwtToken('some jwt token');

/*
 Or with a Kuzzle response.
 For instance, the final OAUTH2 response is obtained with a redirection from Kuzzle,
 and it can be provided to this method directly
 */
kuzzle.setJwtToken(authenticationResponse);
```

```java
// Directly with a JWT Token
kuzzle.setJwtToken("some jwt token");

/*
 Or with a Kuzzle response.
 For instance, the final OAUTH2 response is obtained with a redirection from Kuzzle,
 and it can be provided to this method directly.

```

```objective_c
// Directly with a JWT Token
NSError* error = nil;
[kuzzle setJwtToken: @"some jwt token" error: &error];
if(error) {
  // NSError reprsentation for KuzzleError.IllegalState, when Kuzzle state is .DISCONNECTED
}

/*
 Or with a Kuzzle response.
 For instance, the final OAUTH2 response is obtained with a redirection from Kuzzle,
 and it can be provided to this method directly.

 Here, "authenticationResponse" is an instance of NSDictionary returned by e.g.KuzzleWebView
 */
NSError* error = nil;
[kuzzle setJwtTokenFromResponse: authenticationResponse error: &error];
if(error) {
  // NSError reprsentation for KuzzleError.IllegalState, when Kuzzle state is .DISCONNECTED
}
```

```swift
// Directly with a JWT Token
do {
  try kuzzle.setJwtToken("some jwt token")
} catch {
  // KuzzleError.IllegalState, when Kuzzle state is .DISCONNECTED
}

/*
 Or with a Kuzzle response.
 For instance, the final OAUTH2 response is obtained with a redirection from Kuzzle,
 and it can be provided to this method directly.

 Here, "authenticationResponse" is an instance of Dictionary returned by e.g.KuzzleWebView
 */
 do {
  try kuzzle.setJwtToken(fromResponse: authenticationResponse)
} catch {
  // KuzzleError.IllegalState, when Kuzzle state is .DISCONNECTED
}
```

```php
<?php
use \Kuzzle\Kuzzle;

$kuzzle = new Kuzzle('localhost');

// Directly with a JWT Token
$kuzzle->setJwtToken('some jwt token');


/*
 Or with a Kuzzle response.
 For instance, the final OAUTH2 response is obtained with a redirection from Kuzzle,
 and it can be provided to this method directly
 */
 $kuzzle->setJwtToken($authenticationResponse);
```

Sets the internal JWT token which will be used to request kuzzle.

If the provided token is correct, a `loginAttempt` event is fired with the following object:  
`{ success: true }`

If not, the `loginAttempt` event is fired with the following response:  
`{ success: false, error: 'error message' }`

### setJwtToken(jwtToken)

### setJwtToken(kuzzleResponse)

| Arguments | Type | Description |

| ``jwtToken`` | string | Previously generated JSON Web Token |
| ``kuzzleResponse`` | JSON object | Final Kuzzle response from a 2-steps authentication process |

### Return value

Returns the `Kuzzle` object to allow chaining.

## unsetJwtToken

```js
kuzzle.unsetJwtToken();
```

```java
kuzzle.unsetJwtToken();
```

```objective_c
[kuzzle unsetJwtToken];
```

```swift
