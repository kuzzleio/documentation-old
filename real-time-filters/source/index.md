# Introduction

This documentation section details the filtering syntax of **subscriptions**.  
This is different from document searches, which are performed using [Elasticsearch Query DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.2/query-dsl.html)

Kuzzle subscriptions use a subset of Elasticsearch Query DSL, called Kuzzle DSL.
