# Data insertion

From now on we will add the `?pretty` keyword to requests in order to get human-readable outputs.


## Mapping creation

We will provide to Elasticsearch the mapping (RDBM: schema) of the data we want to index.
Here we create a new document `type` (RDBM: table) called `blogpost` with 6 fields (RDBM: columns).

<aside class="warning">
  The mapping is not mandatory, but if you don't define it before pushing data to Elasticsearch,
  Elasticsearch will infer to define the type of each field for you depending of their content.
  Once defined, the field type can not be changed.

```json
curl -g -X PUT "http://localhost:9200/example/?pretty" -d '{
  "settings" : {
    "index" : {
      "number_of_shards" : 1
    }
  },
  "mappings": {
    "blogpost": {
      "properties": {
        "author": {
          "type": "text",
          "analyzer": "standard"
        },
        "title": {
          "type": "text",
          "analyzer": "english"
        },
        "body": {

        },
        "tags": {

        },
        "status": {

        },
        "publish_date": {

### The id

The number (1 to 5) at the end of the request url defines the id of the document \(RDBM: primary key\).
If you do not specify it, Elasticsearch will assign an id to the document automatically.
For the sake of this example, we explicitly defined the ID of each document (take a look at the last chunk of the URLs).
If you do not specify it, Elasticsearch will automatically generate an ID and assign it to the document.
Even if the ID is actually a String, you can use numbers for convenience.

### The body

The body of the request must contain the content of the document you want to create.
As you can see, the structure of the document matches our mapping.
As a result, Elasticsearch will analyze and index our document as specified.

## The structure

As you can see, we insert an array in a field ment to be a string. It is one of the feature of Elasticsearch;
Any field can be an array of the defined type. For example, the `tags` field is defined as a string, but we chose to use it as an array of strings (and it is totally fine).
Another feature of Elasticsearch is that you can nest a field to build complex documents.
It is not addressed in this cookbook but you can find more information in the
[Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.x/object.html).
