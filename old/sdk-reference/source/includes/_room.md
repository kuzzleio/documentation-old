# Room

This object is the result of a subscription request, allowing to manipulate the subscription itself.

In Kuzzle, you don't exactly subscribe to a room or a topic but, instead, you subscribe to documents.  
What it means is that, to subscribe, you provide to Kuzzle a set of matching filters. Of course, providing an empty filter results in subscribing to all changes occurring on a data collection, emulating the behavior of a traditional topic.

Once you have subscribed, depending on the subscription configuration you provided, you may receive the following notifications:

* a pub/sub message matches your criteria (real-time)
* a matching document is about to be created or deleted (real-time)
* a matching document is created, updated or deleted (once the change is effective in the database)
* a user enters or leaves the room

You may subscribe multiple times to the same room, with identical or different subscription parameters, and with different callbacks. This allow dispatching notifications across the right parts of your application, instead of having to maintain an all-purpose notification consumer (but you can do that, too).

## Notifications

> Document notification example:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "error": null,
  "requestId": "bc41ced6-38fc-42b9-8fd5-22ae0774aac2",
  "controller": "name of the controller that generated the notification",
  "action": "name of the action that generated the notification",
  "collection": "collection name",
  "index": "index name",
  "volatile": {},
  "state": "done",
  "scope": "in",
  "result": {
    "_source": {
      "message content": "this is an example"
    }
  }
}
```

> User notification example:

```json
{
  "error": null,
  "status": 200,
  "roomId": "ID of the room concerned by this notification",
  "requestId": "5897cd2f-a8a2-40b2-aa43-b31898172008",
  "controller": "subscribe",
  "action": "on",
  "protocol": "protocol used by the notifying user",
  "timestamp": 1453193069592,
  "volatile": {
    "optional": "user informations"
  },
  "result": {
    "roomId": "ID of the room concerned by this notification",
    "count": 42
  }
}
```

To subscribe, you must provide a callback that will be called each time a new notification is received.

On the right panel you can see a document and a user notification examples.

### Document notification rundown

| Notification field | Type |Description       | Possible values |
|--------------------|------|------------------|-----------------|
| `result._source` | JSON object | Content of the document or real-time message that generated the notification | |
| `scope` | string | Indicates if the document enters or exits the subscription scope | `in`, `out` |
| `state` | string | Tells if the document is about to be changed, or if the change is effective | `pending`, `done` |


### User notification rundown

| Notification field | Type |Description       | Possible values |
|--------------------|------|------------------|-----------------|
| `action` | string | Indicates if the user enters or leaves the subscribed room | `on`, `off` |
| `volatile` | JSON object | If provided during subscription, contains application specific informations | |
| `result.count` | integer | Updated number of users subscribing to this room | |

## Constructors

```js
/*
 Constructors are not exposed in the JS/Node SDK.
 Room objects are returned by Collection.subscribe and
 Document.subscribe methods.

 You may also use the Collection.room() method:
 */
var room = kuzzle.collection('collection', 'index').room();

room = kuzzle
  .collection('collection', 'index')
  .room({subscribeToSelf: false});
```

```java
Room room = new Room(dataCollection);

RoomOptions options = new RoomOptions().setSubscribeToSelf(false);
Room room = new Room(dataCollection, options);
```

```php
<?php

// not implemented (this SDK uses HTTP and is thus stateless)
```

Creates a Room object.

### Room(Collection, [options])

| Arguments | Type | Description |
|---------------|---------|----------------------------------------|
| ``Collection`` | object | an instantiated Kuzzle Collection object |
| ``options`` | object | Optional subscription configuration |

Available options:

| Option | Type | Description | Default |
|---------------|---------|----------------------------------------|---------|
| ``volatile`` | JSON Object | Additional information passed to notifications to other users | ``null`` |
| ``scope`` | string | Filter document notifications depending on their scope status. You may receive entering documents (scope: ``in``), leaving documents (scope: ``out``), all documents changes (scope: ``all``) or filter these notifications completely (scope: ``none``). This filter does not affect pub/sub messages or user events. | ``all`` |
| ``state`` | string | Filter document notifications depending on the state of the modifying request. You may receive real-time notifications when a document is about to be changed (state: ``pending``), or be notified when the change has been fully written in the database (state: ``done``), or both (state: ``all``). This filter does not affect pub/sub messages or user events. | ``done`` |
| ``subscribeToSelf`` | boolean | (Don't) subscribe to notifications fired as a consequence of our own queries | ``true`` |
| ``users`` | string | Filter notifications fired upon a user entering the room (user: ``in``), leaving the room (user: ``out``), or both (user: ``all``). Setting this variable to ``none`` prevents receiving these notifications | ``none`` |


## Properties

| Property name | Type | Description | get/set |
|--------------|--------|-----------------------------------|---------|
| ``collection`` | string | The subscribed data collection | get |
| ``filters`` | JSON object | The current set of filters of this room | get/set |
| ``headers`` | JSON Object | Common headers for all sent documents. | get/set |
| ``volatile`` | JSON Object | Additional information passed to notifications to other users | get/set |
| ``subscribeToSelf`` | boolean | (Don't) subscribe to notifications fired as a consequence of our own queries | get/set |
| ``roomId`` | string | Unique room identifier | get |

**Notes:**

* the ``headers`` property is inherited from the provided ``Collection`` object and can be overridden
* updating the ``volatile`` property takes effect after ``renew`` is called
* by default, the global Kuzzle ``volatile`` properties are sent along with the subscription request. If a ``volatile`` option is provided during subscription, it will be merged with the global ``volatile`` for the subscription only. In case of conflicts, subscription ``metadata`` take priority over the global ``metadata``.

## count

```js
// Using callbacks (NodeJS or Web Browser)
room.count(function (error, result) {
  // ...
});

// Using promises (NodeJS)
room.countPromise().then(result => {
  // ...
});
```

```java
room.count(new ResponseListener<Integer>() {
 @Override
 public void onSuccess(Integer result) throws Exception {
   //  ...
 }

 @Override
 public void onError(JSONObject error) throws Exception {
   // Handle error
 }
});
```

```php
<?php

// not implemented (this SDK uses HTTP and is thus stateless)
```

> Callback response

```json
1
```

Return the number of subscribers on that room

### count(callback)

| Arguments | Type | Description |
|---------------|---------|----------------------------------------|
| ``callback`` | function | Callback handling the response |

### Callback response

Resolves to a `integer` containing the number of users subscribing to this room.


## renew

```js
room.renew({in: {field: ['some', 'new', 'filter']}}, function (err, res) {
  // called each time a change is detected on documents matching this filter
