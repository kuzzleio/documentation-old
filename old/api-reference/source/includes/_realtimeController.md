Subscription works differently in Kuzzle than with a regular publish/subscribe protocol.
In Kuzzle, you don't exactly subscribe to a room or to a topic but, instead, you subscribe to documents.

What it means is that, along with your subscription query, you also give to Kuzzle a set of document or message filters.
Of course, you may also subscribe to a ``data collection`` with no other matching criteria,
and you'll effectively listen to a "topic".

Once you have subscribed to a room, depending on your filters, you may receive the following notifications:

* whenever a pub/sub message is published matching your criteria (realtime)
* whenever a matching document is about to be created or deleted (realtime)
* whenever a matching stored document is created, updated or deleted (once the change is effective in the database)
* whenever a user enters or leaves the room

Good news is, you may ask Kuzzle to send only the notifications relevant to your application,
by configuring your subscription request (see below).
You can also subscribe multiple times to the same room, with different configurations.
Kuzzle will provide you with a channel for each of these subscriptions,
allowing different part of your application to concentrate on what it needs to process.

The matching criteria you pass on to Kuzzle are based upon [Kuzzle DSL](../real-time-filters)

How subscription works:

* => You send a subscription query to Kuzzle
* <= Kuzzle responds to you with a ``roomId`` and a `channel`

When using `websocket` or `socket.io` protocol, the client will start receiving [notifications](#notifications) right away.  
When using other protocols, such as `MQTT`, the client may have to perform these two extra steps:

* => You listen to the ``channel`` provided in the response
* <= Kuzzle forwards the corresponding [notifications](#notifications) on that channel

```litcoffee
{
  "index": "<data index>",
  "collection": "<data collection>",
  "controller": "realtime",
  "action": "unsubscribe",

  "body": {
    "roomId": "<unique room ID>"
  },

    // query volatile data
  }
}
```

<section class="others"></section>

>**Response**

<section class="others"></section>

```litcoffee
{
  "status": 200,                        // Assuming everything went well
  "error": null,                        // Assuming everything went well
  "index": "<data index>",
  "collection": "<data collection>",
  "controller": "realtime",

  "requestId": "<unique request identifier>",
  "result": {
    "roomId": "<unique Kuzzle room identifier>"
  }
}
```

Instructs Kuzzle to detach you from its subscribers for the given room.
In practice, your subscription won't receive any new message on the room once this action is triggered.

The expected parameter is the `roomId` that Kuzzle returned during the subscription.


## validate

>**Method:** `POST`

<section class="http"></section>

```litcoffee

    // The message to send
}
```

<section class="others"></section>

>**Query**

<section class="others"></section>

```litcoffee
{
  index: "<index>",
  collection: "<collection>",
  controller: "realtime",
  action: "validate",
  // The document itself
  body: {
    ...
  }
}
```

>**Response**

```litcoffee
{
  status: 200,                      // Assuming everything went well
  error: null,                      // Assuming everything went well
  index: "<index>",
  collection: "<collection>",
  controller: "realtime",
  action: "validate",
  volatile: {},
  result: {
    errorMessages: {},              // There is no error messages
    valid: true                     // The document complies with validation specifications
  }  
}
```

Validates data against existing validation rules. The data is not published nor stored by Kuzzle
If the document complies, the `result.valid` value is `true`, if not, it is `false`.
When the document does not complies, both `result.errorMessages` contains some very detailed hints on what is wrong with the document.
Note that if no validation specifications are set for the &lt;data index>/&lt;data collection>, the document always validate.
In any ways, the document is **not** stored nor published.
